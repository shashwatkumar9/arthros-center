              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Posterolateral corner (PLC) repair surgery is one of the most specialized and technically demanding procedures in knee surgery, addressing injuries to the complex network of structures that provide posterolateral stability to the knee joint. At Arthros Center in Patna, Dr. Gurudeo Kumar brings exceptional expertise to this challenging area of orthopedic surgery, serving patients from India, Bengal, North East regions, and Nepal who have sustained these complex injuries. The posterolateral corner is critical for knee stability, particularly during rotational and hyperextension movements.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The posterolateral corner comprises multiple structures including the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), popliteus muscle and tendon, popliteofibular ligament, and the posterolateral capsule. Injuries to these structures often occur in combination with <a href="/pcl-reconstruction" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300">PCL tears</a> or as part of <a href="/multi-ligament-reconstruction" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300">multi-ligament injuries</a>. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar's expertise in PLC reconstruction is essential for patients who have failed conservative treatment or have chronic instability affecting their quality of life and functional activities.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Diagnosis of posterolateral corner injuries requires specialized clinical examination techniques and advanced imaging studies. Dr. Kumar employs specific clinical tests including the dial test, external rotation recurvatum test, and posterolateral drawer test to assess the extent of PLC damage. Advanced MRI sequences and sometimes stress radiographs help confirm the diagnosis and guide surgical planning. The complexity of PLC anatomy requires meticulous preoperative planning to ensure optimal reconstruction outcomes.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Surgical technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction varies depending on the specific structures injured and the chronicity of the condition. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar employs both anatomical repair techniques for acute injuries and reconstruction methods using tendon grafts for chronic cases. The procedure often involves reconstruction of the LCL using tendon autograft or allograft, restoration of the popliteus tendon, and repair or reconstruction of the popliteofibular ligament complex. Computer-assisted navigation ensures precise tunnel placement and graft positioning.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The surgical approach for PLC reconstruction requires extensive knowledge of the complex anatomy around the lateral knee. Dr. Kumar utilizes both arthroscopic and open surgical techniques, often combining both approaches to optimize visualization and minimize tissue trauma. The procedure involves careful identification and protection of the peroneal nerve, which lies in close proximity to the surgical site. Specialized instrumentation and graft preparation techniques ensure optimal biomechanical restoration of the posterolateral corner structures.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Post-operative rehabilitation following posterolateral corner repair is critical for successful outcomes and requires specialized protocols that protect the reconstructed structures while promoting optimal healing. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar's rehabilitation programs are specifically designed for PLC cases, with careful attention to motion restrictions and progressive strengthening. The rehabilitation process typically spans 6-9 months and requires close coordination between the surgical team and specialized physiotherapists experienced in complex knee reconstruction.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For patients traveling from Bengal, North East India, and Nepal, Dr. Kumar's team provides comprehensive care coordination including detailed preoperative evaluation, surgical planning, and post-operative follow-up arrangements. The complexity of PLC reconstruction requires specialized expertise that may not be available in all locations, making Arthros Center a regional referral center for these challenging cases. Telemedicine consultations facilitate ongoing monitoring and rehabilitation guidance throughout the recovery process.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Long-term outcomes following posterolateral corner reconstruction by Dr. Gurudeo Kumar demonstrate excellent success rates in restoring knee stability and function. These complex procedures require exceptional surgical skill and experience, making proper case selection and surgical technique critical for success. Patients can expect significant improvement in knee stability, reduced symptoms of giving way, and return to functional activities. Regular follow-up assessments ensure optimal long-term outcomes and monitor for any potential complications or recurrent instability.
