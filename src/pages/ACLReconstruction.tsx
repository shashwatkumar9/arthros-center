              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                ACL reconstruction surgery is a specialized orthopedic procedure designed to replace a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) with a tissue graft, restoring knee stability and function. At Arthros Center in Patna, Dr. Gurudeo Kumar and his expert surgical team perform this procedure using the most advanced techniques available, serving patients from across India, including Bengal, North East regions, and Nepal. The ACL is crucial for knee stability during pivoting, cutting, and jumping activities, making its reconstruction essential for active individuals and athletes.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Dr. Gurudeo Kumar specializes in anatomical ACL reconstruction, which involves placing the graft in the exact anatomical position of the original ACL. This approach has revolutionized ACL surgery by providing superior biomechanical function compared to traditional non-anatomical techniques. The procedure begins with a thorough evaluation using advanced imaging studies, including MRI and sometimes CT scans, to assess the extent of injury and plan the optimal surgical approach. Dr. Kumar's expertise extends to both single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction techniques, with the choice depending on individual patient factors and activity requirements.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The surgical procedure is performed arthroscopically, using minimally invasive techniques that reduce tissue trauma and accelerate recovery. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar utilizes state-of-the-art arthroscopic equipment and computer-assisted navigation systems to ensure precise tunnel placement and optimal graft positioning. The choice of graft material is crucial for successful outcomes, and Dr. Kumar offers multiple options including hamstring tendon autograft, patellar tendon autograft, and in selected cases, allograft tissue. Each graft type has specific advantages, and the selection is individualized based on patient age, activity level, and personal preferences.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The hamstring tendon autograft is frequently preferred for its excellent strength properties and reduced donor site morbidity. Dr. Kumar employs advanced preparation techniques to create a robust four-strand graft that provides excellent mechanical properties. For patients requiring maximum strength, particularly those involved in high-level athletics, the patellar tendon autograft may be recommended. This "gold standard" graft provides bone-to-bone healing and has a long track record of excellent outcomes in demanding sports activities.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Post-operative rehabilitation is a critical component of successful ACL reconstruction, and Dr. Gurudeo Kumar's team works closely with specialized physiotherapists to develop individualized recovery programs. The rehabilitation process typically spans 4-6 months for recreational athletes and up to 9-12 months for elite athletes returning to competitive sports. Early rehabilitation focuses on controlling swelling, restoring range of motion, and reactivating the quadriceps muscle. Progressive strengthening exercises, proprioceptive training, and sport-specific activities are gradually introduced as healing progresses.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Advanced rehabilitation protocols at Arthros Center incorporate cutting-edge techniques such as blood flow restriction training, which allows for effective muscle strengthening at lower loads, reducing stress on the healing graft. Functional movement screening and biomechanical analysis help identify and correct movement patterns that may predispose to re-injury. Return-to-sport testing is comprehensive, including strength testing, hop tests, and psychological readiness assessments to ensure safe return to athletic activities.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For patients traveling from Bengal, North East India, and Nepal, Dr. Kumar's team provides comprehensive care coordination, including pre-operative planning, surgical scheduling, and post-operative follow-up arrangements. Telemedicine consultations are available for routine follow-ups, reducing the need for frequent travel while ensuring optimal monitoring of recovery progress. The team understands the unique challenges faced by patients from distant locations and provides detailed recovery instructions and local physiotherapy referral networks.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Long-term outcomes following ACL reconstruction by Dr. Gurudeo Kumar are excellent, with success rates exceeding 95% for return to previous activity levels. The anatomical reconstruction technique employed at Arthros Center has been shown to reduce the risk of future ACL injuries and may help prevent early-onset arthritis. Regular follow-up assessments track recovery progress and address any concerns, ensuring optimal long-term knee health and function for all patients, regardless of their geographic location or activity level.
