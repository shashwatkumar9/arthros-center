              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Patella stabilization surgery addresses one of the most challenging and recurrent problems in knee surgery - patellofemoral instability and recurrent kneecap dislocations. At Arthros Center in Patna, Dr. Gurudeo Kumar specializes in comprehensive patella stabilization procedures, serving patients from across India, Bengal, North East regions, and Nepal who suffer from this debilitating condition. Patellofemoral instability significantly impacts quality of life, limiting participation in sports and daily activities while causing persistent pain and apprehension about knee giving way.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The patella (kneecap) is a complex structure that must track properly in the femoral groove during knee motion. When the patella dislocates or subluxates repeatedly, it indicates underlying anatomical abnormalities or soft tissue deficiencies that require surgical correction. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar's approach to patella stabilization encompasses comprehensive evaluation of all contributing factors including bony anatomy, soft tissue restraints, and biomechanical alignment to develop individualized treatment plans for optimal outcomes.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Patient evaluation for patella stabilization requires detailed clinical examination and advanced imaging studies to identify the underlying causes of instability. Dr. Kumar utilizes specialized MRI sequences, CT scans with measurements of anatomical parameters, and sometimes dynamic imaging studies to assess patella tracking. Key factors evaluated include the Q-angle, tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance, trochlear dysplasia severity, and patella height. This comprehensive evaluation guides surgical planning and technique selection.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Surgical techniques for patella stabilization vary depending on the underlying anatomical abnormalities and patient factors. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar employs multiple procedures that may be performed individually or in combination, including medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction, tibial tuberosity osteotomy, trochleoplasty, and lateral retinacular release. The choice of procedures is individualized based on detailed preoperative analysis and surgical findings to address all contributing factors to instability.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is a cornerstone procedure in patella stabilization surgery. Dr. Kumar utilizes advanced arthroscopic and open techniques to reconstruct this critical stabilizing structure using tendon grafts. The procedure involves precise anatomical placement of bone tunnels and graft positioning to restore normal patellofemoral biomechanics. Modern MPFL reconstruction techniques have significantly improved outcomes for patients with recurrent patella dislocation.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When bony abnormalities contribute to patella instability, Dr. Gurudeo Kumar performs specialized osteotomy procedures to correct anatomical alignment. Tibial tuberosity transfer procedures, including anteromedial transfer and distalization, help optimize patella tracking and reduce contact pressures. These complex procedures require precise planning and execution to achieve optimal alignment while avoiding complications. Computer-assisted planning may be utilized for complex cases to ensure optimal correction.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Post-operative rehabilitation following patella stabilization surgery requires careful balance between protecting the reconstructed structures and restoring normal knee function. Dr. Kumar's rehabilitation protocols are specifically designed for patella stabilization cases, with emphasis on progressive strengthening of the quadriceps and hip muscles, proprioceptive training, and gradual return to functional activities. The rehabilitation process typically spans 4-6 months depending on the procedures performed and patient goals.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Long-term outcomes following patella stabilization by Dr. Gurudeo Kumar demonstrate excellent success rates in preventing recurrent dislocations and improving functional outcomes. Patients typically experience significant reduction in apprehension, improved confidence in knee stability, and successful return to sports and activities. The comprehensive approach employed at Arthros Center addresses all contributing factors to ensure optimal long-term stability and function. Regular follow-up monitoring ensures maintenance of patella stability and early detection of any potential issues requiring attention.
