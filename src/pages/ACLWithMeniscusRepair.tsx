              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Combined ACL and meniscus repair surgery represents one of the most comprehensive knee reconstruction procedures available, addressing multiple injured structures in a single surgical session. At Arthros Center in Patna, Dr. Gurudeo Kumar specializes in these complex combined procedures, providing patients from India, Bengal, North East regions, and Nepal with optimal outcomes while minimizing the need for multiple surgeries. This approach is particularly beneficial for patients who have sustained significant knee injuries involving both ACL tears and meniscus damage.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The meniscus serves as a crucial shock absorber and stabilizer in the knee joint, and when combined with <a href="/acl-reconstruction" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300">ACL reconstruction</a>, the surgical complexity increases significantly. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar's expertise in both ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair allows for coordinated surgical planning that optimizes the repair of both structures. The procedure requires careful timing, precise technique, and specialized post-operative rehabilitation to ensure successful healing of both the ACL graft and the repaired meniscus tissue.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Patient selection for combined ACL and meniscus repair is crucial for optimal outcomes. Dr. Kumar evaluates each case individually, considering factors such as the location and pattern of meniscus tears, tissue quality, patient age, and activity level. Peripheral meniscus tears with good blood supply are ideal candidates for repair, while complex or degenerative tears may require alternative treatment approaches. The timing of injury is also important, as acute injuries typically have better healing potential than chronic conditions.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The surgical technique for combined ACL and meniscus repair requires meticulous planning and execution. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar typically begins with arthroscopic evaluation of the entire knee joint, followed by meniscus repair using advanced suture techniques or specialized devices. The <a href="/acl-repair" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300">ACL reconstruction</a> is then performed using anatomical tunnel placement and appropriate graft selection. The coordination of these procedures requires expertise in both techniques and understanding of how they interact during the healing process.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Advanced surgical techniques employed by Dr. Kumar include all-inside meniscus repair methods, which minimize tissue trauma and provide excellent healing rates. For ACL reconstruction, anatomical single-bundle or double-bundle techniques are utilized based on individual patient factors. The choice of ACL graft (hamstring, patellar tendon, or allograft) is carefully considered in the context of the meniscus repair to optimize healing and minimize complications. Computer-assisted navigation may be used to ensure precise tunnel placement while protecting the repaired meniscus.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Post-operative rehabilitation following combined ACL and meniscus repair is more complex than for isolated procedures and requires careful balance between protecting the healing meniscus and promoting ACL graft integration. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar's rehabilitation protocols are specifically designed for combined procedures, with restricted weight-bearing and range of motion in the early phases to protect meniscus healing. Progressive advancement is carefully monitored with regular clinical assessments and imaging studies to ensure optimal healing of both structures.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The rehabilitation program at Arthros Center emphasizes patient education and compliance, as the success of combined procedures depends heavily on adherence to post-operative restrictions. For patients traveling from Bengal, North East India, and Nepal, detailed rehabilitation protocols are provided along with coordination with local physiotherapy providers. Telemedicine consultations allow for ongoing monitoring and adjustment of rehabilitation programs throughout the recovery process.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Long-term outcomes following combined ACL and meniscus repair by Dr. Gurudeo Kumar demonstrate excellent success rates when appropriate patient selection and surgical technique are employed. The preservation of meniscus tissue through repair rather than removal has been shown to reduce the risk of future arthritis and maintain better long-term knee function. Patients typically experience excellent knee stability and function, with return to sports and activities occurring at 6-9 months post-surgery following comprehensive functional testing and clearance.
