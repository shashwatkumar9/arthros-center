              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                ACL repair surgery represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, particularly for fresh, proximal tears where the ligament can be successfully reattached to its original insertion point. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar at Arthros Center in Patna specializes in this innovative approach, offering patients from India, Bengal, North East regions, and Nepal an alternative to traditional ACL reconstruction that preserves the patient's native ligament tissue and proprioceptive function.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The concept of ACL repair has gained renewed interest with advances in surgical techniques and suture technology. Dr. Kumar employs state-of-the-art arthroscopic techniques combined with high-strength suture materials and innovative fixation devices to reattach torn ACL fibers directly to their anatomical insertion sites. This approach is particularly beneficial for acute injuries where the ACL has torn away from the bone (avulsion injuries) or proximal tears with good tissue quality that can be successfully repaired.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Patient selection is crucial for successful ACL repair outcomes. Dr. Gurudeo Kumar carefully evaluates each case using advanced imaging studies and arthroscopic assessment to determine the suitability for repair versus reconstruction. Ideal candidates typically include patients with acute injuries (within 3-6 weeks), proximal ACL tears with good tissue quality, and younger patients where preserving native ligament tissue is advantageous. The procedure involves meticulous debridement of the torn ligament ends, followed by precise suture placement and anatomical reduction.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The surgical technique employed by Dr. Kumar utilizes advanced suture anchor systems and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene sutures that provide exceptional strength and biocompatibility. The repair is typically augmented with internal bracing techniques that provide additional support during the healing phase while allowing controlled early mobilization. This approach has been shown to preserve the native ACL's complex fiber architecture and proprioceptive capabilities, potentially leading to superior functional outcomes compared to reconstruction.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Post-operative rehabilitation following ACL repair requires a carefully balanced approach that protects the healing tissue while promoting optimal functional recovery. Dr. Kumar's rehabilitation protocols are specifically designed for ACL repair patients, with more conservative early mobilization compared to reconstruction cases. The program emphasizes controlled range of motion exercises, gradual strengthening progressions, and proprioceptive training to restore neuromuscular control while respecting tissue healing constraints.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Early rehabilitation focuses on controlling inflammation and maintaining knee mobility within safe parameters. Progressive weight-bearing and strengthening exercises are introduced based on clinical healing signs and patient response. Advanced rehabilitation techniques include neuromuscular electrical stimulation for quadriceps activation, manual therapy for joint mobility, and specialized exercises to restore the complex coordination patterns required for safe return to sports and activities.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For patients traveling from Bengal, North East India, and Nepal, Dr. Kumar's team provides comprehensive pre-operative evaluation to determine repair candidacy, detailed surgical planning, and structured follow-up protocols. Telemedicine consultations facilitate ongoing monitoring of recovery progress while minimizing travel requirements. The team provides detailed rehabilitation guidelines and coordinates with local physiotherapy providers to ensure continuity of care throughout the recovery process.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Long-term outcomes following ACL repair by Dr. Gurudeo Kumar demonstrate excellent success rates in appropriately selected patients, with the added benefit of preserving native ligament tissue and proprioceptive function. Return to sports typically occurs between 6-9 months post-surgery, with comprehensive functional testing ensuring safe return to full activities. The preserved ACL tissue may provide superior joint stability and potentially reduce the risk of future degenerative changes, making ACL repair an attractive option for suitable candidates seeking optimal long-term knee health.
